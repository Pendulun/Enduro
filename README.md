# Enduro
A version of the game Enduro that I had to make for my programming class at the University.<br>
Used ALLEGRO 5 for it and "In the hall of the mountain king - Edvard Krieg" as a background music. There's a pdf file explaining
how the program works but it's in portuguese as I had to do it for my teacher.<br>
The "makefile" is used to compile the game but, if someone would test it, you should change the ALLEGRO foulder in the makefile
to the one where ALLEGRO is in your computer (if its different from "C:").<br>
To compile using the makefile, just type "mingw32-make" (reffering to the exe file of the same name) but you must have MinGW in your 
computer.
